- # 👋 Hi, I'm Anthony Kwong

I'm a PhD candidate in Statistics at the University of Manchester, where I apply mathematical modelling, statistical learning, and sequence analysis to complex biological systems — from birdsong to ancient DNA. My work bridges data science and biological insight, with a focus on building tools that are both theoretically grounded and practically useful.

---

## 🔬 Academic Research

My research explores how cultural and genetic traits evolve over time using probabilistic models, machine learning, and stochastic processes. 

---

## 🛠️ Tools & Packages

- **`birdsong.tools`**: An R package for analysing the temporal features and rhythmic structures of birdsong. 

You can find it in the pinned repositories below.

---

## 📊 Skills & Interests

- **Languages**: R, Python, C++
- **Methods**: Machine Learning (SVM, Random Forest, HMMs), Time Series, SDEs, Bayesian Modelling  
- **Tools**: Rcpp, Stan, Git,LaTeX  
- **Applications**: Bioinformatics, Cultural Evolution, Behavioural Science, Statistical Modelling

## 🤝 Collaboration & Careers

I'm passionate about statistical communication, data-driven discovery, and creating research software that lasts. I’m open to opportunities in:

- **Research & Development**
- **Data Science / Quantitative Analysis**
- **Computational Biology / Behavioural Science**
- **Science Communication / Open Source Projects**
